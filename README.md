# Enverido Java Licensing System Example
This is a very simple Java application which demonstrates how you can use the Enverido Java library to license your
application.

## Requirements
* Use Gradle to build and run the application and its dependencies.

## Usage
Run the application. A menu appears with an example licence and asks for user input. Enter the example licence details
and the application will check whether or not it's valid.

## Notes about this example
This example does not currently demonstrate activating licences. However, it does show how the user can input
their own licence information in order to license the application. The user's input should probably be saved
somewhere so that they don't have to regularly re-enter their licence information.
